        <h1>Test your TAMS II&#160;knowledge</h1>
        <p>Want to test what you know about <MadCap:variable name="products.TAMS" />? We have included checkpoints and test throughout the help and learning center to help you test your knowledge. </p>
        <p>The knowledge checks are only a few questions pertaining to a specific function where the tests cover a broader range of content about multiple functions that are related. </p>
        <p>While we provide a pass/fail percentage, don't worry. We're not keeping track. The knowledge checks and tests are provided to help you identify areas you may want to learn more about.</p>
