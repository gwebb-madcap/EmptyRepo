        <h1>Customer accounts</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/snippets/store-company-icon.flsnp" /> APAR creates customer accounts for you; however, you can add or make changes when needed. </p>
        <p>Customer accounts store  information you need to do business with your repeat customers. You determine how much or how little information to keep on file. <span class="ui">Customer information</span> is where you add and maintain customer accounts. There's lots of data you can collect for each customer, like </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Email addresses for sending invoices and statements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Billing method for customers who want a purchase order or charge account on file.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Custom pricing for customers you want to give discounts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Credit limits, statement types, and accounts receivable terms for accurate invoicing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Authorized buyers who can make purchases on the account without verification.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Email addresses for invoices and statements.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Customer account types</h3>
        <p>Before  creating a new customer account, consider what data you want to keep on file so you can decide which type of customer account to create, like a commercial account or individual account. Two types of customer accounts you can create are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="ui">Retail</span> Typically used for individual customers who may not be business owners but buy parts regularly and may want a payment method on file. If you  want historical sales data so you can offer them special pricing, you need to create a retail account.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="ui">Regular</span> In some stores, <span class="ui">Regular</span> accounts are called <span class="italics">Commercial accounts</span>, <span class="italics">AR&#160;account</span>, <span class="italics">Customer file</span>, or <span class="italics">Charge accounts</span>. These accounts are  large or small businesses who purchase regularly from your store. These customers usually keep a payment method on file. By creating a Regular account, you can track accounts receivable balances,  historical sales data, send statements, set up core tracking,  and offer special pricing.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="ui">Default customer account</span> It's also common for stores to have a  <span class="italics">Default customer account</span>  (that is a  <span class="ui">Retail</span> account type). This is a generic account not associated with a specific customer. Use it to create invoices for customers when you don't want to keep customer information on file. In some stores, <span class="italics">Default customer account</span> is also called <span class="italics">Cash customer</span> or <span class="italics">Customer 0</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <h3>Store ownership groups</h3>
            <p>Maintain customer account information at the main store and send changes to your branch stores. If you are using <span class="product">Multi Store</span>, branch stores automatically receive updates. </p>
            <p>If you are not using <span class="product">Multi Store</span>, you'll see the a message when you close the <span class="ui">Customer information</span> screen asking if you want to send changes to branch stores. Choose <span class="ui">Yes</span> to send updates now. Or, you can send them later using <span class="ui">A/R update</span>. <MadCap:expanding><MadCap:expandingHead>Where is it?</MadCap:expandingHead><MadCap:expandingBody>&#160;</MadCap:expandingBody></MadCap:expanding> Go to <span class="ui">Accounts receivable</span> &gt;<span class="ui">  Branch transmission</span>. <span class="SMEQuestion" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #b22222;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Question for reviewer: &#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Is this the full path to the A/R update screen? Which environment is set up?&#160;</span></p>
