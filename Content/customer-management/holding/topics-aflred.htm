        <p>(Process Guide) How to add a new customer (Include search for an available customer number to use when creating a new customer and a List of Reserved AR Numbers) (Help in HLC?)</p>
        <p>(Guide) How to setup Tax Tables (Not related to this course)</p>
        <p>(Guide) How to create Misc. Charges and assign exemptions to customers (Include common ways these are used) (HLC and/or Screencast)</p>
        <p>1. we don't show the full search feature. Rational used was this has been shown several times in other videos, is everyone okay with just a short verbal call out, or do we want the full search tutorial every time? A quick mention that they can use the search should be fine. Maybe you can highlight the button as you mention it.</p>
        <p> 2. Is the tokenization process mandatory for COS and optional for jobbers to use? All COS participate in the Tokenization program. For jobbers it's an optional feature that requires them to be on SafePay.</p>
        <p>3. Misc. charges was noted as vague and there is a pretty lengthy example. Are we just wanting more types of misc charges listed on the front end? If so what are common ones to use other than env fee/tax? We need to make sure that we are explaining that this where we make the customer exempt from existing MISC. Charges and not where we add them.</p>
