        <h1>Set up customer notes</h1>
        <p>Customer notes are a way of adding specific information to a customer's invoice. For example, if a customer has specific delivery instructions about who or where to leave parts, you can add it as a note. Once notes are added, assign them to each customer as needed. </p>
