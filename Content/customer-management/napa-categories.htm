        <h1>NAPA categories</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="products.Napa" />&#160;categories represent rebate programs customers qualify for special pricing while you receive money back. Customers must meet the criteria to qualify for the program typically based on the type of  services the customer offers. For example, an independently-owned garage offering auto repairs can qualify for the <span class="italics">Garage</span> category. On the other hand, vocational training facility can qualify for the <span class="italics">Vo-tech school</span> category. </p>
        <p>The following <span class="ui">NAPA&#160;categories</span> are already set up. The below table shows the code, name, and the type of account that qualifies for the rebate. </p>
