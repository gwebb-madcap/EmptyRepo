        <p>For example, if 3 of 5 parts were originally received and 2 parts  arrived in this shipment, enter 5. Post to inventory as you normally would. This is not necessary when receiving with an RF&#160;scanner, because the received quantities increment automatically. If receiving from the <span class="ui">Received goods</span> screen, the <span class="ui">Quantity rec</span> remains there for reference.</p>
