        <p> A customer account number is required to create an invoice. When you need to sell and invoice a customer without saving customer information,  use the <span class="italics">Default customer account</span> that is not associated with a specific customer. In some stores, <span class="italics">Default customer account</span> is also called <span class="italics">Cash customer</span> or <span class="italics">Customer 0</span>.</p>
