        <h1>Manage on-hand inventory</h1>
        <p>On-hand inventory quantities impact many aspects of your business from stock replenishment to customer sales. Maintaining accurate inventory  levels ensures you  order adequate quantities to meet your store's demand, provide sales staff with updated on-hand quantities, and keep obsolete parts off your shelves.</p>
        <p>Keep your on-hand quantities accurate with these daily tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Receive and post freight when it arrives to keep available quantity count accurate when creating customer invoices.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Adjust quantities  for damaged parts, stolen parts, or when receiving mistakes are made.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Remove returned defective and core parts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Return obsolete parts on classification returns to avoid having non-listed parts display throughout <MadCap:variable name="products.TAMS" />. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Complete buyout purchase orders (pickups) to account for inventory transactions of parts received outside the <MadCap:variable name="products.Napa" /> supply chain sold for profit.</p>
