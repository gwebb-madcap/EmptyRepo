        <p class="authorNote">The <span class="ui">Cash received journal</span> is a record of all the funds your store collects (tender during checkout)&#160;during each accounting day. When you reconcile transactions at the end of each day, you balance the <span class="ui">Cash received journal</span> by entering the total amount of the cash and checks you collected so funds tendered match funds received. </p>
        <p class="authorNote">When  funds you tendered do not match funds collected, the <span class="ui">Cash received journal</span> is <span class="italics">out of balance</span>. As you enter totals for cash, checks, verify other incoming and outgoing cash, account for overages and/or shortages, you bring the Cash received journal into balance. Once in balance, you are ready finalize the <span class="ui">Cash received journal</span> for the day, to&#160;close your business day. </p>
