    <p>Messages are notifications for incoming orders, returns, or communications from other systems. Messages remain pending until they are acknowledged. Once  acknowledged, a message is ready for an action, like creating an invoice, sourcing a part, returning a part, viewing <MadCap:variable name="products.NXP" /> sales history, or processing a communication.</p>
