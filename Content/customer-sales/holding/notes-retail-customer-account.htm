        <p>Ex from Alfred</p>
        <p>This is one of many: Mobile mechanic roles into town. Has no interest or time to setup a charge account with the store but would like his company info to show up on the invoice for tax reporting purposes. Counterperson sets up up a Retail Customer and saves the day.</p>
        <p>Another scenario how this feature could be used is if the store has a DIY customer who is often buying parts from the store. The store could setup a Retail Customer to track this individuals purchase history or even offer a little better pricing than what a typical walk in customer would get. Another added benefit to doing this is if that DIY customer ever opens a shop of his own, the Retail Account can be easily converted to a Regular Account (Charge Account) and all the history and pricing will follow.</p>
