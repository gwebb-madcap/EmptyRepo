                <p>This report can be used to investigate an inventory value discrepancy.  When reviewing multiple reports at the same time, you may be able to identify specific areas of inventory value rise or fall.</p>
                <p>You can also use this report to justify your inventory investments by monitoring the inventory of a specific line code. You note what section of the line code the change is in, and then run RPT111 to complete your research.</p>
                <p><span class="ui">Selection Criteria</span> You can sort this report by High Value.  To do so, enter the high value dollar amount.  High value is compared to part cost multiplied by quantity on hand.  If the dollar amount is greater than the high value, that part is listed on the report as exceeding the high value.</p>
