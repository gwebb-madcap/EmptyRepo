If your store tracks daily start and stop times, employees record this information when they log in and out. You can establish limits for lunch and breaks and review any time card exceptions. Authorized personnel can review pay period activity and hours for vacation and sick time, prior to closing each pay period.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p MadCap:conditions="tams.DoNotDistribute">A record of time worked in completed pay periods for the current year</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p MadCap:conditions="tams.DoNotDistribute">A summary of employee annual pay cycle totals</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p MadCap:conditions="tams.DoNotDistribute">A record of completed training courses</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>While some independent store jobbers have 1 employee in system and all users use it. there's no tracking or accountability for who did what because all are using same id. </p>
        <p>Employee numbers cannot be deleted Multi store must consolidate employee numbers because employee numbers are associated with historical information, like acknolwedging messages, tendering and checkout invoices in tams.</p>

        <p>Best practice for phone room</p>
        <p>If using <span class="ui">Phone Room</span>, add the same employee  in all stores. For example, <span class="italics">Store 001 </span>(central store), <span class="italics">Store 002</span>, and <span class="italics">Store 003</span> are configured for <span class="ui">Phone room</span>. If Employee 24 is using <span class="ui">Phone room</span> at Store 001 to complete orders, then Employee 24 must be active at Store 002 and Store 003 to print delivery orders at those stores.</p>
        <p>The <span class="ui">Security</span> tab allows, denies, or provides view only access to menus and sub-menus in <MadCap:variable name="products.TAMS" />. </p>
        <p>The first level in the list represents a menu option, and the lower levels represent the sub-menus available for the option above it. For example, <span class="ui">Sales activities</span> is a menu option. <span class="ui">Receive payment on account</span> and <span class="ui">Review today's sales</span> are options that are available after you select <span class="ui">Sales activities</span>.</p>
