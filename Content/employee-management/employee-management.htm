        <h1>Employee management</h1>
        <p>As store manager,  set up new employees and manage their access in <span class="ui">Employee management</span>. This is where you  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Add new employees and set their initial log in and password.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Edit employee information like name address, whether they are hourly or salary,  and password expiration date.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Grant access to specific <MadCap:variable name="products.TAMS" /> menus and submenus.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Terminate employees.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each employee needs an <span class="ui">Employee number</span>. These are user-specific meaning each user has a different <span class="ui">Employee number</span>. Employee numbers track each employee's actions. Because <span class="ui">Employee numbers</span> are associated with the user's action history, you cannot delete them from&#160;<MadCap:variable name="products.TAMS" />.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/snippets/store-independent-icon.flsnp" /> Multi store ownership </p>
        <p><span class="ui">Employee numbers</span> are store-specific which means the same <span class="ui">Employee number</span> can exist at different stores. To avoid conflicts between multiple stores, assign users the same <span class="ui">Employee number</span> at all stores. This ensures tracking each employee and also makes it easy for employees to remember their log in. </p>
